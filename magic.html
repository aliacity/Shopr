                Shopr is a revolutionary mobile application which will change the way you shop.
                Everyday shopping is a classic example of the popular combinatorics Knapsack problem,
                where shoppers are trying to maximize the items they get whilst keeping the cost at a
                minimum.<br>Shopr aims to solve this problem by using an algorithm that - although 
                the problem is one that mathematically cannot be correct and fast in all cases - 
                calculates to a high degree of accuracy all the time.

                    Shopr aims to provide quick results with every interaction. 
                    As soon as you begin typing the name of an item to add to the list our quicksearch
                    starts filtering to suggest items based on what’s in the database.  This is made
                    possible by Google’s Firebase cloud Firestore.  Firestore is a No-SQL database
                    that performs on both Android and iOS .  Firestore keeps data in sync across the app thru
                    real-time listeners and provides offline service that work regardless of latency or connectivity.
                    This helps to ensure that the app always provides the latest price data available.

                    Our entire codebase was developed and maintained using react Native.
                    The same open-source framework behind major apps like Instagram, AirBnB and UberEats.
                    React native is the choice of many developers because it allows for the development of
                    applications for use on multiple systems and gives developers the support of the vast 
                    community of react native developers.
